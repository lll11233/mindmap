            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="background-color: #c02637; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px ;">Unconventionally Sweet was made as a result of trying to change a digital tech project to more of the creators liking. Given a task to document a model of a train boom gate, Lauren had the idea of changing it into a drive thru. Using Katie Le‚Äôs imaginative design skills and meticulous detailed nature, and Lauren‚Äôs knowledge in electronics, Unconventionally Sweet was born.</p>
            <p style="background-color: #c02637; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px ;">The project allowed me to make a project that was personal and I felt proud with. It allowed Katie and I to create something using all our skill sets in a real world application. For me, Unconventionally sweet allowed me to have an opportunity to continue creating circuits, electronics and use computational thinking in a creative way. - Lauren</p>

        <p style="background-color: #c02637; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px ; position: absolute; bottom: 0; width: 100%; text-align: center;">The project was essentially a business pitch with models of how the drive thru would work with Arduinos, cardboard and toy cars. In addition, food was made. </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <div class="divider" style="width: 100%; height: fit-content; margin: 20px 0; justify-content: center; ">
            <div style="background-color: #c02637; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px ; position: absolute; width: 50%; margin-left: 10px; text-align: left;"><p>The initial ideation was slow, until we started thinking about what we would want if we were business owners. We asked ourselves questions such as ‚Äúwhat do we like to eat‚Äù. We decided to put a twist on sweet food, taking inspiration from food creators who intertwine staple American food products with Asian cuisine in a fun way. <br> From there, the brand‚Äôs identity was created. Identifying the identity of the drive thru helped create quick and effective progress </p>
                <p>Along the way, problems did occur (especially with the circuitry).</p>
                <p>I remember having difficulties with running the circuitry as there were multiple parts on the Arduino boards, wires everywhere and it was just hard to see. Later on I got Mr Talbot to help find the issues with the board. Having another eye is really helpful when trying to find where the problems are.</p>

                <p>The general reception of the concept was seen as positive, both from peers and teachers. Katie and I were really proud of our work and hence showed some of our teachers. Some even tolled us to trademark the business!</p>
                <blockquote>Our design technology teacher was very happy with the project saying ‚Äúthe project was really creative and that this was an example of a future project students could undertake to elevate the initial task‚Äù. This was in the context of that he was a new teacher at the school, so he wanted to see what we can do. This communicated that we should continue doing things outside the box.</blockquote>
