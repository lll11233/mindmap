        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
        <h3 style="background-color: white">How does this show interests, skills, capabilities and values?</h3>
        <p>Fleet Space is a company that is driven by AD ASTRA: </p>
        <p>Agile Action — Take action. Independent, fast, frugal action. <br>

          Seek Truth — Be curious. Explore. <br>
          
          Take Responsibility — Empower ourselves to make and own decisions. <br>
          
          Radical Ideas — Embrace your uniqueness and do things differently. <br>
          
          Always Deliver — Find a way to deliver consistently.</p>
          <p>The company’s sense of embracing new ideas and seeing where it takes can be demonstrated by even the smallest people in the room. On the last day, we presented our idea for our STEM basket project to the company. Laughs were met with our idea, including the CEO. We later found out the company try out the solutions created by the work experience students. <br><br>

            The central idea that wraps the whole company together in my opinion is the sense of curiosity and wanting to explore which the company envisions themselves as “We are Explorers”. In each individual, I encountered I saw people who were passionate, curious about what they did. Something off topic, but while I looked around the buildings I noticed something reoccurring, also found it in Alauda; the decor. The small details etched on walls to the payload model in front room 8a. <br><br>
            
            When visiting the company, I saw a workplace that was diverse and inclusive. I want to work at a place like Fleet because it allows me to be my authentic self, whilst pushing me to be the best individual I can be in the work I share. Throughout the week I developed capabilities in soldering (mind to hand coordination), computational thinking, design skills and problem solving. I had conversations with like minded people about our passion for the space industry. Sharing that love, curiosity and drive for answers was the highlight of the experience. <br></p>
        <h3 style="background-color: white">How might this impact your future aspirations, pathways or skill development?</h3>
        <p>
          By participating in this work experience program, I displayed and got to immerse myself in activities that involved the space industry. Personally, I don’t see myself building satellites, but rather using the information that the satellites possess, to inform my discoveries. Understanding the technology that the space company has to offer, I have learnt how I could apply these instruments. <br><br>
          The people I had conversations with, came from a wide range of areas and not necessarily space or science. One person we met had wanted to go do dramatic arts after high school, but then didn’t get in. He didn’t have a degree before working at Fleet in manufacturing. He constructed products at a satellite company. However, he is one of the most experienced people in what he does. <br><br>
          None of them had a linear trend, or maybe didn’t have a specific degree, but they had experience by applying themselves. For this reason, I want to/continue experiencing as much as possible in life and increase my skills in digital technology through creating projects I am passionate about, such as my language buddy.
