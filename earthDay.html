        <div id="alWorden" style="text-align: left;">
          <p style="text-align: left; font-size: smaller;">In 2023, I applied for the Al Worden Endeavour Scholarship. This scholarship is awarded to students who have demonstrated a commitment and interest in STEM fields especially in space. 5 young people across Australia are given the opportunity to represent Australia at a global astronaut camp in USA. I didnâ€™t get into the further rounds after applying. The reason why I wanted to do it was because I want to be an astrophysicist working with people across the world to discover it!/p>

          <p style="text-align: left;font-size: smaller;">I then tried again in 2024. At the end of 2024, I was announced that I was apart of the top 20 finalists for the Al Worden Endeavour Scholarship. Though I didn't get the scholarship, it echoed an important message.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;font-size: smaller;">The video speech I presented in 2023 was very similar to the 2024 submission (copied and pasted the intro). Sure I had more experiences to share, however this time I didn't just give words I gave a tangible demonstration of what I had done through imagery. Even though it was a small portion of the video, in my opinion it spoke hundreds of words about me. I learnt that people want me to see what I love to do in action. They don't just want to hear it, they want to see it. This can be reaffirmed when I was at work experience. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;font-size: smaller;">This implicit feedback has made me understand what I need to do to action my dreams. Currently, I am building a robot and saying YES to everything, but more so creating things that I want to see. Just do it! Stop dreaming about what you want to be and just do it anyway. Maybe next year I will get there and get to discover a little bit of whats in space.</p>
