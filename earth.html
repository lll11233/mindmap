        <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: left;">A digital frontier showcased the wide range of projects I have made. From food to games, these projects showcased my skill in programming and technology in a wide range of applications. They showed my love of problem solving, creativity and competence in visualising concepts through a digital medium. <br>
            Each one unique to the other, a central theme of collaboration and connection has been shown in each one. The success has been a resultant of the feedback I have been given by my peers, emphasisng to the idea that constructive critiscm or having an open mind. They arenâ€™t perfect, but they showcase my experimental nature to try something new and continue to work on it.
            <br> As the creator of these projects, I aimed to create an experience for the people who consume my work. I hope even if its not perfect, people can find a deeper meaning and appreciate it. This links back to my love of people and my altruistic and creative nature.
