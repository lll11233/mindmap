                            Currently, I wouldn’t say I am very reliable in a materialistic doing sense, but my integrity in my values rings true. This is because I do not like the hypocrisy in the world, and hence want to be a person that can be considered honest/reliable. This can be seen when I am talking to my friends or any other person. My opinion is usually the same and doesn’t sway/nor how I interact with people.<br>
                            
                            I am a very passionate person. This can be seen when I am talking about science or watching a really good movie. I get excited and want to nit pick on or the ingenious of the topic.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; padding: 10px; font-size: small; " >Altruism is a word for something I am just realising as an individual sums up me when I am with my peers or friends. I am their biggest cheerleaders and I want them to succeed. This can be seen when I want to help my friends, whether that be talking to someone when they don’t have the courage. Looking back at the positive change, I wouldn’t do anything differently, even at the cost of myself. This analysis is quite accurate of me. <br>

                            I would say I am somewhat charismatic, especially when I am trying to persuade someone to join in the action for a game etc. Though deep down I am not very charismatic as I don’t use my charisma that often and hence don’t identify with it.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; padding: 10px; font-size: small; " >The statement surrounding being unrealistic rings true to me as I set big goals without thinking the time/effort that needs to be put in for it to fruition. This can be shown when I am doing my digital technology projects. For instance, I wanted to create an all accessible leaderboard system for my text-based game in python for an assignment. This would’ve meant that it didn’t matter where or what you were using to play the game, the leaderboard would have correct information. After countless hours and being sick, the leaderboard didn’t really work. <br>

                            This statement would be very true when I was 13. However, now as I continue to venture through society, I understand more about the behavior of people. Concepts such as truth or justice, is something I believe in. But now I realise there are grey lines. I still am idealistic, however I take everything with a touch of salt. <br>
                            
                            I agree on how I am overly empathetic. This can be shown when I help people out because I believe in their reasoning, but sometimes forget that I can’t do it for everyone, but more importantly I am not expected to fix everyone’s problems. I am reminded by my older sister, Grace. My sister isn’t too empathetic, meaning she reasons with the problems/lives of people, but doesn’t forget the true nature of people’s behavior.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; padding: 10px; font-size: small; " >This passage connected how my career path is driven by my sense of wanting to create a meaningful impact in the lives of people through charismatic leadership and being an empathetic communicator. These strengths can be demonstrated in how I interact with my peers in school. When in team-work situations, I try to inspire others to contribute to the bigger picture - strategic vision that can lead them to gain something. This can be shown when I was rallying my fellow peers to participate in the annual swimming carnival this year. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; padding: 10px; font-size: small; "> <em>Finding the Deeper Issues</em> is a text that I deeply identify with as an ENFJ, especially now. I love going to school. I love challenges. I love creating connections with different ideas to myself. However, I don’t like completing stagnant work now. For me, I want to create a piece of work I can say I am proud of and that shows what I learnt, not what I already know. This idea of being proud of my work comes from when I was in Year 4-5. My teacher said that if you knew there was something you could change in that moment, it wasn’t your best work. She wanted us to feel proud of the work we completed, so we would hold showcases for every ERP (educational research project) we would do. This philosophy contributes to how I create work that has a noticeable impact on myself or on others. Whether that be a laugh or a new exciting idea that has never been heard of, I want to create a meaningful moment for people viewing my work. <br>

                            The passage notes on how work that is repetitive or isolated can be frustrating for me, as these roles don’t allow me to be creative or create meaningful contributions. This can be shown in school work. I pay attention in classes where I get to be creative, problem solve, think deeply and create connections with the people around me about my work. Hence, I spend less time or effort on tasks that are for the point of just completion, because it feels like its wasting my time when I could be solving world hunger.</p>

I love people. Talking with people, rather than another medium of communication, is the best way I can get my point/perspective across. However, I do notice that I value the opinions people have of me and hence become self-critical. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: medium ;"> The results showed I had an intuitive nature, which links to a nature of thinking about the ‘bigger picture’. As someone who would consider having a sense of scientific thinking and an open mind, I think daily about the possibilities of an issue that may be occurring. For example, when I am on the bus I may be reading the news. This may spring a topic of dilemma and I start thinking of the ‘what if’ for an hour. Thought Patterns survey states 88 percent of people with an intuitive trait spend a lot of time thinking about what if scenarios. This I can vouch for. A downside towards this nature is that I may not be very practical. I spend so much time thinking about deep and complex ideas, before I can action something. This can set back growth. A prime example of the setback of growth is the long completion of the blueprint for this shuttle. </p>
